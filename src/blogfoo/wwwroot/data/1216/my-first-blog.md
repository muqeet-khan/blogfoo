### TL;DR
1. You dont need a database
2. Based on ASP.NET Core so this should be able to run on any platform.
3. Uses open source projects.

## blogfoo
 blogfoo is a free and open-source ASP.NET MVC Core based blogging platform. Don't as me why but I just din't want to use a database for storing my blog entries. Now, dont get me wrong, Wordpress and the likes are awesome. I just dint want something that was heavy. I realized 80% of the features of my wordpress blog were never used. Not because they are bad; just because I never found the time or inclination to research them.

 Now I am a developer. A .net developer. I have always wanted to have a blogging platform that was truly .net based. Not using a database is just a happenstance. 

 Code and further information about the project is located at [github](https://github.com/muqeet-khan/blogfoo)

 PS: I also wrote this software because wordpress is blocked at work. Now I can make MD files and update my blog :-)
